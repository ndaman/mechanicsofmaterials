custom themes can be added to this directory:
reveal.js\css\theme

latex find and replace regex:
  (easier to first convert w/ pandoc, then edit that)

convert tikz drawings to svg files
  copy filname.tex to filename-figs.tex
  add to preamble:
    \usepackage[active,tightpage]{preview}
    \PreviewEnvironment{tikzpicture}
  pdf2svg filename-figs.pdf output-page%03d.svg all


internal links:
  add id to slide using: <!-- -- id="test-slide" -->
  with this line in html: data-attributes="--\s(.*?)$"
  then link using: [test](#/test-slide)

pdf's:
	reveal.js pdf printing has not been very reliable, so instead I created a simple Makefile to build pdf's from my markdown file, just type "make" to build all unbuilt files, for make "filename.pdf" to only build a single file
	I have tried to automatically correct some of the most common issues, but occasionally there are characters that do not translate and will need to be converted from their unicode to a latex command.

want to write some customizations
  automatically build a shell/outline given some main topics
  snippets for new section and new sub-slide
  build script to update index file after creating new lecture (no script, just use doctoc)
  make handout version?

other thoughts
  allow users to change theme
