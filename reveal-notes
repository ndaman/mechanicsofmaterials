custom themes can be added to this directory:
C:\Users\a723k873\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\reveal-md\node_modules\reveal.js\css\theme

build command
reveal-md slides.md --static docs --static-dirs=images
  NOTE: I think this is completely unnecessary?!? instead of reveal-md I'm just using reveal.js, html file header points to the markdown file for slide content, no compiling needed at all

want to write some customizations
  automatically build a shell/outline given some main topics
  snippets for new section and new sub-slide
  build script to update index file after creating new lecture (no script, just use doctoc)
  make handout version?

other thoughts
  images folder? (done)
  group lectures by exam sub-folders? (would be easy, is it worthwhile?)
  allow users to change theme


autocomplete figures (add to config.cson)
    {
      extensions: [
        "png"
        "PNG"
        "jpeg"
        "jpg"
      ]
      prefixes: [
        "!\\[.*\\]\\("
      ]
      relative: true
      scopes: [
        "source.gfm"
      ]
    }
