custom themes can be added to this directory:
C:\Users\a723k873\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\reveal-md\node_modules\reveal.js\css\theme

build command
reveal-md slides.md --static docs --static-dirs=images

want to write some customizations
  automatically build a shell/outline given some main topics
  snippets for new section and new sub-slide
  build script to write slides.md to static html and update index file appropriately

other thoughts
  images folder?
  group lectures by exam sub-folders?
  allow users to change theme
