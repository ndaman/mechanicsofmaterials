\textbf{\Large Project 3}

\textbf{Due 3 December 2021}
\end{center}

Dr. Smith is now convinced he wants to install a St. Peter's Cross mechanism with his leg vise, but he wants to size the pieces to limit the bending deflection.
This project will build off the analysis already performed in Projects 1 and 2.
%recover points from project 1
\begin{itemize}
  \item Find the maximum principal stresses in the vise screw (20 points).
	\item Design the St. Peter's Cross members such that under the loading case designed for they deflect no more than 0.5 in.
		Compare at least three different beam designs (cross-sections) in your analysis (50 points)
	\item Do the stresses and displacements you have found seem reasonable for your chosen materials? What surprised you in your analysis? (20 points)
	\item Your overall presentation quality (legibility, professionalism, grammar) will also be worth 10 points
\end{itemize}
