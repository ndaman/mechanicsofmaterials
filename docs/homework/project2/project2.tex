\textbf{\Large Project 2}

\textbf{Due 8 October 2021}
\end{center}

Before adding a leg vise to his workbench, Dr. Smith wants to better understand some of the stresses and deflections.
This project will build off the analysis already performed in Project 1.
%recover points from project 1
\begin{itemize}
	\item When fully loaded, how far does the vise screw stretch due to axial loading (25 points)
	\item When fully loaded, how far does the vise screw twist due to torsion? (25 points)
	\item When fully loaded, what is the maximum bending stress in the St. Peter's Cross mechanism (25 points)
	\item Do the stresses you have found seem reasonable for your chosen materials? What could be done to mitigate any problematic stresses? (15 points)
	\item Your overall presentation quality (legibility, professionalism, grammar) will also be worth 10 points
\end{itemize}
