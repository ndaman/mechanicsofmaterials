# superposition

----
## superposition

-   Some problems are too complicated to solve all at once
-   Instead, we break them up into two simpler problems
-   Each "sub-problem" must still satisfy equilibrium
-   Problem must be linear and the deformation should be small enough that it does not cause moment-equilibrium issues

---
# statically indeterminate

----
## statically indeterminate

-   There are many problems that are at least slightly over-constrained
-   While this is common engineering practice, it creates too many variables for statics analysis
-   These problems are called "statically indeterminate"

----
## statically indeterminate

-   One extra equation we can use is called "compatibility" or the "kinematic condition"
-   We know that at the displacement must be equal on both sides of any arbitrary section we make in a member
-   We can separate a member into two parts, then use compatibility to relate the two unknown forces

## statically indeterminate

![A 5 m long, vertically-oriented bar is fixed at both ends, with a 500 N downward load applied 2 m from the top.](../images/statically-indeterminate.jpg) <!-- .element width="25%" -->

----
## example 4.7

<div class="left">

![A 0.8 m long rigid horizontal bar is supported by hanging from 3 vertical rods. Rod AB supports the left end, rod CD supports the middle and rod EF supports the right end. A 15 kN load is applied 0.2 m from the left end.](../images/example-4-7.jpg)

</div>

<div class="right">

Assuming the bottom bar is rigid, find the force developed in each bar.
AB and EF have cross-sectional areas of 50 mm<sup>2</sup> while CD has a cross-sectional area of 30 mm<sup>2</sup>.

</div>

# force method

----
## force method

-   One way to solve statically indeterminate problems is using the principle of superposition
-   We choose one redundant support and remove it
-   We then add it back as a force separately (without the other forces in the problem)

----
## force method

![An illustration of the force method, we have the same statically indeterminate problem as before, a 5 m long, vertically-oriented bar is fixed at both ends, with a 500 N downward load applied 2 m from the top. We set this equivalent to a bar with the same load, but no support on the bottom end. We then add a force which will provide enough displacement to cancel out the displacement introduced by removing the load.](../images/force-method.png)

----
## force method

-   We connect the two problems by requiring that the displacement in both frames adds to 0 to meet the support requirements
-   This is referred to as the equation of compatibility

----
## procedure

-   Choose one support as redundant, write the equation of compatibility
-   Express the external load and redundant displacements in terms of load-displacement relationship
-   Draw free body diagrams and use the equations of equilibrium to solve

----
## example 4.9

![A 1200 mm long horizontal rod is fixed at its left end and has a fixed support 0.2 mm away from its right end. A 20 kN load is applied to the right 400 mm away from its left end.](../images/example-4-9.jpg)

The steel rod shown has a diameter of 10 mm. Determine the reactions at A and B'.

# thermal stress

----
## thermal stress

-   A change in temperature cases a material to either expand or contract
-   For most materials this is linear and can be described using the coefficient of linear expansion

`$$\delta_T = \alpha \Delta T L$$`

----
## thermal stress

-   When a body is free to expand, the deformation can be readily calculated using
-   If it is not free to expand, however, thermal stresses develop
-   We can use the force method described previously to find the thermal stresses developed

----
## example 4.12

<div class="right">

An aluminum tube with cross-section of 600 mm<sup>2</sup> is used as a sleeve for a steel bolt with cross-sectional area of 400 mm<sup>2</sup>. When T=15 degrees Celsius there is negligible force and a snug fit, find the force in the bolt and sleeve when T=80 degrees Celsius.

## problem 1

<div class="left">

The A36 Steel bar is constrained to just fit between two fixed supports when `$T_1 = 60^\circ\text{F}$`.
If the temperature is raised to `$T_2 = 120^\circ\text{F}$` determine the average normal stress developed in the bar.
Note: you may use `$\alpha = 6.5\times 10^{-6 \circ} \text{F}^{-1}$`

<div class="right"> <!-- .element width="70%" -->

The rigid beam is fixed to the top of three posts made from A992 steel and 2014 T-6 aluminum.
The posts each have a length of 250 mm when no load is applied to the beam and the temperature is `$T_1 = 20^\circ \text{C}$`.
Determine the force supported by each post if the bar is subjected to a uniformly distributed load of `$150 \text{ kN/m}$` and the temperature is raised to `$T_2 = 80^\circ \text{C}$`
Use `$E_{st} = 200 \text{ GPa}$`, `$E_{al} = 70 \text{ GPa}$`, `$\alpha_{st} = 12 \times 10^{-6 \circ} \text{C}^{-1}$` and `$\alpha_{al} = 23 \times 10^{-6 \circ} \text{C}^{-1}$`

# torsion

----
## torsion

-   Torque is a moment that tends to twist a member about its axis
-   For small deformation problems, we assume that the length and radius do not change significantly under torsion
-   The primary deformation we are concerned with in torsion is the angle of twist, denoted with `$\phi$`

----
## shear

![A thin disk under applied torsion. The shear strain varies linearly with radial distance from the center.](../images/torsion-disk.jpg) <!-- .element width="40%" -->

----
## torsion formula

-   For a linearly elastic material, Hookeâ€™s Law in shear will hold (`$\tau = G \gamma$`)
-   This means that, like shear strain, shear stress will vary linearly along the radius

----
## torsion formula

-   We can find the total force on an element, *dA* by multiplying the shear stress by the area

`$$ dF = \tau dA$$`

-   The torque (`$dT = \rho dF$`) produced by this force is then

`$$dT = \rho(\tau dA)$$`

----
## torsion formula

-   Integrating over the whole cross-section gives

`$$T = \int_A \rho (\tau dA) = \frac{\tau_{max}}{c} \int_A \rho^2 dA$$`

-   The integral `$\int_A \rho^2 dA$` is also called the Polar Moment of Inertia, *J*, so we can write

`$$\tau_{max} = \frac{Tc}{J}$$`

----
## polar moment of inertia

-   We know that `$J=\int_A \rho^2 dA$`, so we can compute this for some common shapes
-   For a solid circular cross-section, we have

`$$J = \int_0^c \rho^2 (2\pi \rho d\rho) = \frac{\pi}{2}c^4$$`

-   For a circular tube we have

`$$J = \int_{c_1}^{c_2} \rho^2 (2\pi \rho d\rho) = \frac{\pi}{2}(c_2^4-c_1^4)$$`
