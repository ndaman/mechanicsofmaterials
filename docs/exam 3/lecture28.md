# superposition

## superposition

-   The differential equation `$EI \frac{d^4v}{dx^4} = w(x) $` satisfies the requirements for superposition
-   `$w(x)$` is linearly related to `$v(x)$`
-   Load does not significantly change the shape of the beam

----
## superposition

-   This means we can superpose multiple deflection solutions from simpler cases
-   Appendix C in the text has many solutions that can be superposed

## example 12.13

Use superposition to find the displacement at C and the slope at A

Use superposition to find the displacement at C

## example 12.16

The steel bar is supported by springs with k=15 kip/ft originally unstretched. For the force shown, determine the displacement at C. Take $E_{st}=29$ Msi and $I=12\text{ in}^4$.
