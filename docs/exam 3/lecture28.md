# superposition

----
## superposition

-   The differential equation *EId*<sup>4</sup>*v*/*dx*<sup>4</sup> = *w*(*x*) satisfies the requirements for superposition
-   *w*(*x*) is linearly related to *v*(*x*)
-   Load does not significantly change the shape of the beam

----
## superposition

-   This means we can superpose multiple deflection solutions from simpler cases
-   Appendix C in the text has many solutions that can be superposed

The steel bar is supported by springs with k=15 kip/ft originally unstretched. For the force shown, determine the displacement at C. Take $E_{st}=29$ Msi and $I=12\text{ in}^4$.
