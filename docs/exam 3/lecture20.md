## thin-walled pressure vessels

-   If the radius to wall thickness ratio is 10 or more, we can treet a pressure vessule as “thin-walled”
-   Cylindrical pressure vessels will have two primary sources of stress, and serve as an introduction to more general states of combined loading

## cylindrical vessels

-   From equilibrium of a section of a cylindrical vessel, we see that
$$\\begin{aligned}
  \\sum F\_x &= 0\\\\
  &= 2(\\sigma\_1 t dy) - p (2r) dy\\\\
  \\sigma\_1 &= \\frac{pr}{t}
\\end{aligned}$$

## cylindrical vessels

-   Considering another section we can find the longitudinal stress
$$\\begin{aligned}
  \\sum F\_y &= 0\\\\
  &= \\sigma\_2 (2\\pi rt) - p (\\pi r^2)\\\\
  \\sigma\_2 &= \\frac{pr}{2t}
\\end{aligned}$$

----
## spherical vessels

-   We can find the stress in spherical vessels using an identical section to the longitudinal section for a cylindrical vessel, and we find that
$$\\sigma = \\frac{pr}{2t}$$
-   Which is valid everywhere in a cylindrical vessel

----
## example 8.1

-   A cylindrical pressure vessel has an inner diameter of 4 ft and a thickness of 1/2 in.
-   Determine the maximum internal pressure it can sustain if the maximum stress it can support is 20 ksi.
-   What is the maximum internal pressure a spherical pressure vessel could sustain under identical conditions?
