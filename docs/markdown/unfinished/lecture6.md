stress-strain
=============

<span>stress-strain</span>

-   Most engineering materials can be characterized by their stress-strain diagram

-   Comes from a tensile or compressive test, where a load is applied (gives stress) and the strain is measured (via an extensometer or strain gauge)

-   “Engineering stress” is plotted on the y-axis vs. “engineering strain” on the x-axis

<span>elastic behavior</span>

-   Most of the time, the linear region is the one we are most interested in

-   In this region, the material is elastic, meaning when the load is removed the material will return to its original state

<span>elastic behavior</span>

-   Because the stress-strain curve is a straight line, we can relate stress and strain with a single constant

-   This constant is known as the *modulus of elasticity* or *young’s modulus*
    *σ* = *E**ϵ*

<span>plastic behavior</span>

-   Yielding occurs when stress increases beyond the “yield stress” or “elastic limit”, this is when plastic deformation occurs, meaning the material will not go back to its original shape

-   Strain hardening is common in many metals, and means as more stress is applied the material becomes more stiff

<span>plastic behavior</span>

-   Necking occurs when the material begins to have a noticeable “neck” due to being stretched very thin and lower forces are required to deform the material

<span>true stress-strain</span>

-   True stress and strain use the actual material cross-section (instead of the original cross-section) to calculate stress and strain

-   In the elastic region the difference is negligible, so in many cases we just stick with engineering strain, even if we know it is “wrong”

<span>ductile materials</span>

-   Ductile materials can undergo large strains before failure

-   One way to report how ductile a material is is known as percent elongation

-   Steel, brass, molybdenum, and zinc exhibit similar ductile stress-strain characteristics

-   Aluminum is often considered ductile, but it’s stress-strain behavior is a bit different

<span>brittle materials</span>

-   Materials that exhibit little or no yielding before failure are called *brittle*

-   Cast iron, concrete, and glass are common brittle materials

-   Brittle materials fail easily in tension, but are very strong in compression

<span>strain hardening</span>

strain energy
=============

<span>strain energy</span>

-   Work in physics is defined as force times distance

-   As a force is applied to a material, the energy from the work done by the load is stored in the material and called strain energy

-   In engineering, we often use the strain energy density, or the amount of strain energy per unit volume of material
    $$u = \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma \\epsilon$$

<span>toughness</span>

-   Graphically, the area under the stress strain curve represents the strain energy density

-   We call the entire region (usually for a ductile material) the “toughness”

-   Some hardened steels have a high failure strength, but are not very ductile, this gives them a lower toughness

<span>example 3.3</span>

poisson’s ratio
===============

<span>poisson’s ratio</span>

-   When a material is stretched in one direction, it tends to contract in the transverse direction

-   The ratio of transverse to axial strain is called “Poisson’s ratio”
    $$\\nu = - \\frac{\\epsilon\_{transverse}}{\\epsilon\_{axial}}$$

shear stress-strain
===================

<span>shear stress-strain</span>

-   It can be experimentally difficult to obtain a state of pure shear, but a common method for many materials is to place a thin tube in torsion

-   For most engineering materials, the shear stress-strain behavior is linear in the elastic region, but has a different constant relating stress to strain, known as the “Shear Modulus”
    *τ* = *G**γ*

<span>elastic constants</span>

-   For most materials, *E*, *G* and *ν* are related by the following expression
    $$G = \\frac{E}{2(1+\\nu)}$$

<span>example 3.5</span>
