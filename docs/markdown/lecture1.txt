[education]{}

-   B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Brigham Young University

    -   Worked with ATK to develop tab-less gripping system for tensile
        testing composite tow specimens

    -   Needed to align the specimen, as well as grip it without causing
        a stress concentration

-   M.S. and Ph.D. from School of Aeronautics and Astronautics at Purdue
    University

    -   Worked with Boeing to simulate mold flows

    -   First ever mold simulation with anisotropic viscosity

[research]{}

-   No simulation is currently able to predict fiber orientation from
    these processes

-   Part of the challenge is that we only have information from initial
    state and final state

-   I want to quantify intermediate stages using a transparent mold

[0.60]{}

-   Composites are being used in 3D printing now

-   Printing patterns are optimized for isotropic materials

-   Sometimes composites hurt more than they help

[grades]{}

-   Grade breakdown

    -   Assessment Test 2%

    -   Class Participation 3%

    -   Homework 10%

    -   Exam 1 20%

    -   Exam 2 20%

    -   Exam 3 20%

    -   Final Exam 25%

[grades]{}

-   Follow a traditional grading scale

[curve]{}

-   I do NOT curve final grades

-   Instead, each individual exam is curved on a best-fit linear scale

-   This scale is somewhat subjective, best score is mapped to 100, I
    pick one other score to map that I feel is representative of a C or
    a B

-   The end goal of this curve is to get a standard deviation close to
    10% and a class average representative of the performance on the
    exam, usually between a C+ and a B

[class expectations]{}

-   Consider the cost (to you or others) of your being in class

-   I ask that you refrain from distracting behaviors during class

-   When you have something more important than class to take care of,
    please take care of it outside of class

[homework]{}

-   In general, homework assignments will be due every Monday by
    midnight

-   We use Mastering Engineering for homework in this class

-   You are allowed 5 incorrect answers (-3% for each incorrect answer)

-   The first assignment is graded as pass/fail and is to help you
    become familiar with the online homework system

[assessment test]{}

-   The assessment test will be graded, and accounts for 2% of your
    final grade

-   You should do your best, but it is meant as a measure of what you
    have learned before starting this class, so no study or preparation
    materials will be provided

-   You will be provided with an equation sheet taken from the inside
    cover of your textbook

-   Bring a scientific calculator (capable of sine and cosine)

[assessment test topics]{}

-   Vector mechanics (cartesian vector notation, summation of vectors)

-   Friction (static coefficient of friction)

-   Dot product

-   Torque (i.e. moment due to offset forces)

-   Equilibrium (extension of vector mechanics)

[assessment test]{}

-   Test will consist of both multiple choice and working problems

-   The test will be fixed at 50 minutes

-   The purpose is to determine how well-prepared you are for mechanics
    of materials

-   We are trying to determine which students need extra help (both you
    individually and in general for future students), this test is part
    of ongoing research and is optionally accompanied by a survey

mechanics
=========

[Mechanics]{}

-   Generally subdivided into three branches

-   Rigid-body mechanics

-   Deformable-body mechanics

-   Fluid mechanics

[rigid-body mechanics]{}

-   Statics - bodies in equilibrium (rest or constant velocity)

-   Dynamics - bodies under accelerated motion ($F=ma$)

equilibrium of a deformable body
================================

[loads]{}

-   Surface loads act on the surface of a body, can be either
    concentrated forces or distributed loads

-   Body forces are developed inside a body, some examples are gravity
    or electromagnetic fields

[support reactions]{}

-   In general, if a support prevents translation in a given direction,
    then a reaction force must be developed in that direction

-   Similarly, if a support prevents rotation about an axis, then a
    couple moment must be developed about that axis

[equilibrium]{}

-   For a body to be in equilibrium the balance of forces and the
    balance of moments must both be zero $$\sum F_i =0$$ $$\sum M_i =0$$

-   For 2D problems, this reduces to $$\begin{aligned}
                \sum F_x &= 0\\
                \sum F_y &= 0\\
                \sum M_O &= 0
            \end{aligned}$$

[internal resultant loadings]{}

-   We use statics to find resultant loadings acting within a body

-   This is done using the method of sections

[internal resultant loadings]{}

-   Normal Force, N - acts perpendicular to an area

-   Shear Force, V - lies in the plane of an area, causes two segments
    to slide over one another

-   Torsional Moment, T - tendency to twist about an axis perpendicular
    to an area

-   Bending Moment, M - tendency to bend the body about an axis lying
    within the plane of the area

[planar problems]{}

-   In planar problems, where all forces lie in the same plane, we only
    have

-   Normal Force

-   Shear Force

-   Bending Moment

[summary]{}

-   Support reactions

-   Free body diagram

-   Equations of equilibrium
